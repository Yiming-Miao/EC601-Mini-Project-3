## Different Environment:
### REACT Native:
React Native (RN for short) is Facebook ’s open source cross-platform mobile application development framework in April 2015. It is a derivative of Facebook ’s earlier open source JS framework React in the native mobile application platform. It supports iOS and Android platforms. RN uses Javascript language, similar to HTML JSX, and CSS to develop mobile applications, so technicians who are familiar with Web front-end development can enter the field of mobile application development with little learning.
### ios SWIFT:
Swift is an open source programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms and compilers. Apple released it at the WWDC (Apple Developer Conference) in 2014 for developing iOS, OS X, and watchOS applications.Swift combines the advantages of C and Objective-C and is not limited by C compatibility.Swift can use the same runtime environment as Object-C on Mac OS and iOS platforms.
